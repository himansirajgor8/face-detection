# Face Detection Project

This project uses computer vision techniques to detect human faces in both live video feed (via webcam) and still images. It's built using Python and OpenCV, making it lightweight, fast, and easy to use.

## 🔍 Features

- Real-time face detection using webcam
- Face detection in image files
- Display bounding boxes around detected faces
- Easy-to-use and extendable codebase

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy (optional, for image array manipulation)

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
